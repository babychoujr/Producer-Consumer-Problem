# Producer-Consumer-Problem
A common problem in concurrent programming is the producer-consumer problem.  In this project, there is a buffer where producers can add items into a bounded buffer.  On the other hand, a consumer job is to remove items from the buffer.  The producers and consumers are going to be threads that can only access the buffer one at a time.
